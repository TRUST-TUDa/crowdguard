CrowdGuard is a client-side backdoor defense in Federated Learning. 

We recently integrated it successfully
into the OpenFL framework: https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl .
Please check the implementation there within openfl-tutorials/experimental/CrowdGuard.

The corresponding paper was published as: Rieger, Krau√ü, Miettinen, Dmitrienko, and Sadeghi, "Crowdguard: Federated backdoor detection in Federated Learning" at NDSS 2024.
